# Runix Cloud server Setups

## Overview
Runix.cloud is a personal homelab server running in my UBC dorm in collaboration with ![Hamzah Chaudhary](https://github.com/hamzahchaudhry), designed for hosting web services, virtual machines, and various experiments. This repository contains the configuration files and automation scripts used to manage and deploy my homelab setup efficiently.

## Server Specifications (Matsya for now)
- **Model:** Lenovo System x3250 M6
- **Processor:** Intel Xeon E3-1220v6
- **Memory:** 32GB ECC DDR4 RAM
- **Storage:** 256GB SSD (OS) + 4x 3.5" hot-swap bays (future expansion)
- **Networking:** Dual 1GbE NIC + Dual SFP+ 10GbE NIC
- **Management:** IPMI for remote monitoring and management
- **Operating System:** Proxmox VE (running multiple VMs & containers)

## Use Cases
- **Web Hosting** - Running Nginx-based web servers.
- **Virtual Machines & Containers** - Managing various services using Proxmox.
- **SSH Access** - Secure remote access for development and administration.
- **Networking Experiments** - Testing VPNs, routing, and firewall rules.
- **File Storage & Backup** - Hosting personal and project-related files.
- **Self-Hosting Services** - Running various self-hosted applications.

## Network & Accessibility
The server is currently **not publicly accessible** for security reasons. Instead, I use **Tailscale VPN** to securely connect to it from anywhere. Friends and family can request access to specific services through Tailscale.

### **Future Plans for Public Access**
Eventually, the server will be accessible via **runix.cloud** or **matsya.runix.cloud**. For now, only one main server is accessible, but in the future, specific services will be reachable through subdomains.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- **Proxmox configurations** (`/etc/pve`, `/etc/qemu-server`, `/etc/lxc`)
- **Network settings** (`/etc/network/interfaces`, firewall rules, DNS settings)
- **NGINX configuration** (reverse proxy, web hosting setup)
- **System automation scripts** (cron jobs, systemd services)
- **Backup configurations** (Proxmox `vzdump` settings, storage mappings)

## Deployment
To replicate or restore this setup on another machine:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matsya-setup.git ~/runix.cloud/matsya-setup

# Copy configuration files (ensure backups first)
rsync -av ~/runix.cloud/matsya-setup/ /etc/

# Restart services to apply changes
systemctl restart networking nginx pveproxy
```
(Note: Ensure sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` and private keys are excluded.)
